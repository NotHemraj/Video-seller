# Telegram Bot Design Document

## Overview
This document outlines the design for a Telegram bot that sells videos using Telegram's Stars currency. The bot will allow users to browse available videos, purchase them using Stars, and receive the purchased videos.

## Bot Features

### Core Features
1. **Video Listing**: Display available videos with descriptions, previews, and prices
2. **Stars Payment Integration**: Process payments using Telegram's built-in Stars currency
3. **Video Delivery**: Securely deliver purchased videos to users
4. **Admin Management**: Allow administrators to add, remove, and update videos

### User Roles
1. **Regular Users**: Can browse videos, make purchases, and view purchased content
2. **Admin Users**: Can manage video inventory, view sales statistics, and handle user issues

## Command Structure

### User Commands
- `/start` - Introduction and welcome message
- `/help` - Display available commands and their descriptions
- `/list` - List all available videos with basic information
- `/view [video_id]` - View detailed information about a specific video
- `/buy [video_id]` - Initiate purchase process for a specific video
- `/mypurchases` - List all videos purchased by the user

### Admin Commands
- `/admin` - Access admin panel (restricted to authorized users)
- `/addvideo` - Add a new video to the catalog
- `/removevideo [video_id]` - Remove a video from the catalog
- `/updatevideo [video_id]` - Update video information
- `/sales` - View sales statistics
- `/broadcast` - Send a message to all users

## Data Structure

### Video Object
```
{
    "id": "unique_video_id",
    "title": "Video Title",
    "description": "Detailed description of the video",
    "preview_url": "URL to preview image or short clip",
    "price": 100,  # Price in Stars
    "duration": "10:30",  # Video duration
    "file_id": "telegram_file_id",  # For delivering the video
    "category": "Category name",
    "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"]
}
```

### User Object
```
{
    "user_id": telegram_user_id,
    "username": "username",
    "is_admin": false,
    "purchases": [
        {
            "video_id": "video_id",
            "purchase_date": "timestamp",
            "price_paid": 100
        }
    ]
}
```

## Payment Flow
1. User selects a video to purchase
2. Bot generates a Telegram payment invoice with the video price in Stars
3. User completes payment through Telegram's payment interface
4. Bot verifies payment success
5. Bot delivers the video to the user
6. Purchase is recorded in the user's purchase history

## Video Storage and Delivery
- Videos will be stored using Telegram's file storage system
- Each video will have a unique file_id assigned by Telegram
- When a user purchases a video, the bot will send the video using the stored file_id
- This approach leverages Telegram's infrastructure for file storage and delivery

## Security Considerations
- Bot token will be stored securely and not exposed in the code
- Admin authentication will be implemented to prevent unauthorized access
- Payment verification will ensure transactions are completed before delivering content
- User data will be stored securely and access will be restricted

## Implementation Plan
1. Set up basic bot structure with command handlers
2. Implement database for storing video catalog and user information
3. Create video listing and viewing functionality
4. Integrate Stars payment system
5. Implement video delivery mechanism
6. Add admin management features
7. Test all functionality
8. Deploy the bot
